The class String includes methods for examining individual characters of the sequence, for comparing strings, for searching strings, for extracting substrings, and for creating a copy of a string with all characters translated to uppercase or to lowercase. Case mapping relies heavily on the information provided by the Unicode Consortium's Unicode 3.0 specification. The specification's UnicodeData.txt and SpecialCasing.txt files are used extensively to provide case mapping.
